## what is I Am Rich app
I Am Rich is a 2008 mobile app for iPhones which had minimal function 
and was priced at US$999.99 (equivalent to $1,359 in 2022). The app was 
pulled from the App Store less than 24 hours after its launch. Receiving 
poor reviews from critics, only eight copies were sold. In the years since,
several similar applications have been released at lower prices.
